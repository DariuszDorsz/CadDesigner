The "CadDesigner" application is a platform that enables constructors to offer their design services. This application aims to facilitate the connection between constructors and clients in need of professional design services. Constructors can register within the application, showcase their skills, and present their portfolio of projects. Potential clients can browse constructor profiles and initiate contact with those who meet their requirements.
